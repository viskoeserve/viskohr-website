        <h4>Rise in technical issues</h4>
        <p style={{lineHeight: "30px",wordSpacing: "2px"}}>During online interviews on the free video platforms like
Skype or Zoom video calls, it is possible to encounter technical faults. It can be quite
embarrassing for a recruiter to be suddenly switched out of a conversation or call
due to an electrical outage, while having an unstable internet connection can be
awkward. This also means if the company isnâ€™t good at technology, they might
encounter such glitches more often</p>

        <h4>Lack of AI integrated features</h4>
        <p style={{lineHeight: "30px",wordSpacing: "2px"}}>Artificial Intelligence (AI) can significantly enhance
various aspects of the job recruitment process, streamlining workflows, improving
efficiency, and enhancing the overall experience for both recruiters and candidates.
However, none of the existing job portals incorporate AI features for job
recruitment</p>

        <h4>Lack of useful information</h4>
        <p style={{lineHeight: "30px",wordSpacing: "2px"}}>Job portals pretty much work by using resume
information to match people. Unfortunately, information available through job
portals is not enough to do an intelligent match. Recruiters see very similar resumes
of hundreds of applicants making it impossible to figure out which candidate seems
to be relevant or better for the job at hand</p>

        <h4>Fraudulent applications</h4>
        <p style={{lineHeight: "30px",wordSpacing: "2px"}}>Some applications might be fake to get information about
the company or hiring officer (a common espionage tactic). Simultaneously,
spammers might use the information posted online to promote a service or product</p>

        <h4>Lack of data-driven recruitment</h4>
        <p style={{lineHeight: "30px",wordSpacing: "2px"}}>Data analysis helps in making the online
recruitment process more effective and efficient. Hiring analytics can help your
company achieve its desired business results;</p>

        <h4>Biased recruitment process</h4>
        <p style={{lineHeight: "30px",wordSpacing: "2px"}}>A stereotypical recruitment process that does not
promote diversity or enhance inclusion makes the hiring monotonous and
subjective. Most companies fail to commit objective hiring due to unconscious bias,
resulting in the loss of great candidates. An unprejudiced recruitment process
ensures diversity in the workforce and also helps in creating a strong brand    .</p>
